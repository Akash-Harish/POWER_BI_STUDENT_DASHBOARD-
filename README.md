# POWER_BI_STUDENT_DASHBOARD-
Project Overview: Developed an interactive and comprehensive dashboard for the STUDENT DASHBOARD leveraging Power BI and SQL to analyze and visualize various performance metrics.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection & Preparation:

Gathered data from multiple sources. Used SQL for initial data cleaning, transformation, and validation to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Data Modeling:

Created complex data models in Power BI to connect various datasets. Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns and measures to enhance data insights.

Visualization:

Designed dynamic and interactive visualizations in Power BI to represent key performance indicators such as count of students, paid fees and status of student. Created supplementary charts and SQL for detailed data analysis and cross-referencing.

Interactivity:

Implemented features like drill-throughs, slicers, and filters in Power BI to allow users to interact with the data and gain deeper insights. Linked SQL and Power BI reports for seamless data integration and real-time updates.

Insights & Reporting:

Provided actionable insights through comprehensive reports, helping stakeholders understand trends, strengths, and areas of improvement. 

Performance Monitoring:

Enabled real-time performance monitoring and comparative analysis of students through the Power BI dashboard. Developed detailed reports for in-depth statistical analysis and historical performance tracking.

Collaboration & Presentation:

Collaborated with team members to refine data requirements and visualization needs. Presented findings and demonstrated the dashboard functionalities to stakeholders, ensuring clear communication of insights.

Tools & Technologies:

Power BI: For data modeling, visualization, and interactive dashboard creation. SQL: For data collection, cleaning, initial analysis, and supplementary reporting. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For advanced calculations and data manipulation in Power BI. Power Query: For data extraction and transformation tasks.

Impact:

Enabled real-time performance tracking and comparative analysis of Students. Enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of data reporting and analysis processes through the integration of Power BI and SQL.
